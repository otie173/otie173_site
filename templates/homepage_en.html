          <h2>Why was this created?</h2>
          <p>I wanted to create a simple landing page for myself, but at the time, I didn't want to dive into complex CSS frameworks. So, I decided to create my own. By applying some basic styles to headings and other elements, you can instantly give your site an attractive look without much effort.</p>
          <p>The main idea behind this project is to make life easier for people who want to create something simple yet appealing, but don't have the time or desire to delve into the intricacies of web development.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Keep in mind that this project is still a work in progress. I'll be adding new features and refining them to make it production-ready in the near future. Stay tuned!</b>
